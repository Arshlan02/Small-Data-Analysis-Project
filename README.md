In this Small Data Analysis Project we will see how data will be Analyzed. And,How to extract the data from bunch of information or file.
In this project, I learn how to work on a real project of Data Analysis with Python. 
At first I created number of questions given below regarding with the project and then I solved that questions with the help of Python. 
It is a project of Data Analysis with Python or you can say, Data Science with Python.

Questions:

Q. 1) Instruction ( For Data Cleaning ) - Find all Null Values in the dataset. If there is any null value in any column, then fill it with the mean of that column.
Q. 2) Question ( Based on Value Counts )- Check what are the different types of Make are there in our dataset. And, what is the count (occurrence) of each Make in the data ?
Q. 3) Instruction ( Filtering ) - Show all the records where Origin is Asia or Europe.
Q. 4) Instruction ( Removing unwanted records ) - Remove all the records (rows) where Weight is above 4000.
Q. 5) Instruction ( Applying function on a column ) - Increase all the values of 'MPG_City' column by 3.

The commands that used in this project :

* import pandas as pd -- To import Pandas library
* pd.read_csv - To import the CSV file in Jupyter notebook
* head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5)
* shape - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe
* df.isnull( ).sum( ) - It detects the missing values from each column of the dataframe.
* fillna() - To fill the null values of a column with some particular value
* value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied to a single column only.
* isin() - To show all records including particular elements
* apply() - To apply a function along any axis of DF



What is Data Analysis?
Data Analysis: Data analysis is the process of analyzing data in various formats. Even though data is abundant nowadays, itâ€™s available in different forms and scattered over various sources. Data analysis helps to clean and transform all this data into a consistent form so it can be effectively studied.

Once the data is cleaned, transformed, and ready to use, it can do wonders. Not only does it contain a variety of useful information, studying the data collectively results in uncovering very minor patterns and details that would otherwise have been ignored.

So, you can see why it has such a huge role to play in research. Research is all about studying patterns and trends, followed by making a hypothesis and proving them. All this is supported by appropriate data.
